ubuntu-bash-mining is a set of bash scripts examples to simplify automatization of your cryptocurrency mining. In this repo used example for [ethminer](https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer.git) tool. For building instructions please visit original repo.

* Sample pool connection string syntax (pool [nanopool](https://nanopool.org))
* Example of bash script for checking if mining already run, and start if not run (TODO)
